## **🚀 Getting Started 🚀**

To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine. You will need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) & [PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) installed in order to run the website locally.

Once you have cloned the repository and installed Python and PostgreSQL, open `load_data.sql` present in `data` folder of this repository. Then run each query to create database and tables. At the end of `load.sql` replace path `C:\Users\Public\data` with your local path.

Now open terminal and create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`. Activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux or `.\venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows.

Next, install all of the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After the dependencies have been installed, you can start the local development server by running `python manage.py runserver`. This will start the server and open the website in your default browser.
